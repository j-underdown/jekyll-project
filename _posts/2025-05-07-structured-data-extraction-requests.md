> **Audience:** Analysts and data-adjacent stakeholders who handle custom data extraction requests.  
> **Goal:** Provide a lightweight template to reduce friction, improve clarity, and structure data extraction requests.

## "How many active users do we have?"

This common question often signals a deeper need. If it’s a routine metric, chances are it’s already available in a dashboard like Tableau or Looker. But if the question is novel or not covered by existing tools, an analyst may need to do a custom data extraction.

## Why data extraction requests can get messy

If you expect to receive extraction requests—even occasionally—it’s worth having a lightweight request template on hand. Without some structure, stakeholders rely on instinct and past habits. Some will be clear and thorough, but others might send vague asks like:

> “How many active users do we have?”

This seems simple, but lacks crucial context:  
- Are we talking monthly or daily active users?  
- What platform, time frame, geography, or product feature?  
- How urgent is this, and why is it being asked?

Without this clarity, the analyst has to chase down missing details—causing delays, distraction, and potential frustration. Over time, this friction can affect how stakeholders perceive analysts: as slow, overly process-driven, or hard to work with.

Every request is a chance to build trust—or erode it. A simple template helps reduce ambiguity and ensures stakeholders provide the right level of detail upfront.

## Adapt this template to your needs

This template can be adjusted to match your org’s tools and habits. You might want to pre-fill common metrics, restrict formats, or integrate with Slack, Jira, or Google Forms.

## 🔧 Proposed Template

### 🔍 **Request overview**
- **Title of Request**: Short, descriptive name  
- **Requester Name & Team**  
- **Date Requested**  
- **Deadline (if any)**  
- **Urgency**

---

### 🎯 **Objective**
- What decision or analysis is this data supporting?  
- How does this relate to company goals or priorities?  
- Is this a one-time extraction or a recurring need?

---

### 📊 **Data requirements**
- **Metrics**:  
  - Is it already tracked in a dashboard?  
  - If not, how should it be defined?

- **Dimensions & Filters**:  
  - Date (with granularity)  
  - Country / Geography  
  - Platform  
  - User Type  
  - Other relevant filters (e.g., product features, customer segments)  
  - Time range: “H1 2025”, “2024–2025”, etc.

- **Sample or full data?**

---

### 🛠️ **Output format**
- Preferred format: CSV, spreadsheet, chart, dashboard  
- Delivery method: Email, Slack, shared drive, etc.

---

### 🧠 **Context / Additional Info**
- Related past requests or ongoing projects  
- Important context about usage or interpretation  
- Attach mockups, sketches, queries, or examples

---

### 🔐 **Data sensitivity**
- Will this include PII or sensitive info?  
- Who should have access?

---

## Rolling it out and setting expectations

Implementing a clearer request process might increase or decrease request volume. Some stakeholders may submit more (because it’s easier), others may self-serve more often. Encourage people to consult dashboards first and link what they've checked before submitting a request.

Also, be transparent about prioritization:  
- How are requests evaluated?  
- What happens if someone disagrees with a priority?

Clear process = better alignment = higher impact.

---

### Tooling ideas
You can embed this into your daily workflows using:

- **Documentation**: Add to internal analytics guides  
- **Slack**: Pin the template or create a slash command  
- **Google Forms**: Route requests to a shared inbox  
- **Jira**: Use a custom ticket form  
- **LLMs**: Have an AI assistant rewrite vague asks into this format

---

### Communicate it clearly

Before you make this the new normal, bring key stakeholders into the loop. Explain why it matters, gather feedback, and adjust the format or tools accordingly.

Make sure you clarify:
- Where the template lives  
- Who reviews and prioritizes  
- Typical turnaround times

> Clear expectations = faster delivery, better insights, and fewer bottlenecks.
